# Simple MIDI Control Panel
Simple home-made MIDI controller based on Arduino MEGA. It uses library https://github.com/tttapa/MIDI_controller and includes
buttons for notes for switch articulations/modes/etc for some instruments;
potentiometers for generation MIDI Controller Change signals;
rotary encoders for using at DAW.

One button uses for switch banks, and keys will generate octave up notes (from C-1 till C2). It's a good example for this.

The schema of the Panel will be included later, after all the intentions will be applied.
